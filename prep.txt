    // write a NEW function called game(). use the previous function inside
    // this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or
    // loser at the end. -- Use loops, and at this point use console.log to 
    // display the results of each round and the winner at the end.

    // use prompt() to get input from the user

    // feel free to re-work your previous functions if you need to. specifically
    // you might want to change the return value to something more useful.

    // feel free to create more "helper" functions if you think it would be useful
